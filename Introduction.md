# Introduction #

Welcome to the Rattle Wiki. Rattle was created by Dr Graham Williams, to be used as a teaching tool for data mining, as well as a GUI for data mining and interacting with the programming language R. Rattle is designed to be used with both R code as well as point and click. Rattle also has a feature to log what has happened in Rattle, so you can easily learn the code through example.

# Rattle Walk Throughs #

The original Rattle Walk Throughs were developed by Tony Nolan, with the support and guidance from Graham.

The Walk Throughs tell a simple story, which describes a problem, uses a provided dataset, and shows a worked example of an exercise to solve the problem. There are a series of short and longish examples. These cover the many different facilities of Rattle, and of data mining and analytics in general.
