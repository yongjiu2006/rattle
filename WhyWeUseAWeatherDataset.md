# Introduction #

Why it makes sense to use the weather as a example data set.


# Details #

Weather is major factor in our daily decision making, that affects us in the areas of our leisure activities, our dress and fashion coverings, transportation and communications, and impacts on shopping, working, and health / survival. By definition the weather is current & near future state of the atmosphere given for a particular location. In practicable terms, weather is the term given to describe a series of environmental variables & measurements, which categorise their impact on how we conduct our activities. For instance, the level of temperature, the speed of the wind, the amount of light, the chance of getting wet, and the amount of radiation we receive at any time, influence our behaviour in ways like, how we dress, which mode of transportation, what time we undertake certain activities, and the risk to the completion of our activities in a safe and desired outcome. Usually this in simple terms means, that we assess the condition, adapt accordingly, and on our historical based experience, we undertake decision making to try and get to work or school safely without catching a cold, having an accident or getting too wet.

This is what we call Meteorological intelligence, and usually we take it for granted as such an every day activity, we think nothing of it. When we were deciding on a dataset as an example for this book, and after some discussion, the weather dataset was chosen. This was because it was available, easily accessed, free of charge, was a dataset which matched the needs of the contributors of this book and the topic of the dataset was so common and everyday, that the reader would have some understanding and experience of the weather.

As with any dataset, our knowledge grew in the metadata of the topic. We started off with a simple goal of trying to predict the chance of rain tomorrow. We thought that it would be nice for our readers to better understand the possibility of getting wet the next day. We soon found that the data set offered much more, in usefulness and complexity.

At this stage in the chapter, I would like invite you to take a few minutes to think on these questions.

  * 1.	How does the weather effect you?
  * 2.	What type of activities are effected by the weather?
  * 3.	What is the commercial impact of the weather?
  * 4.	How dependent are we on the weather?
  * 5.	How at risk are we from the weather?

I am now assuming that after some focus time, you have discovered that the weather has a greater impact than you first may have realized. What we have discovered, is that the weather seems to have an impact on almost every type of human activity, and some mechanical activity too. A sudden or unexpected change in weather conditions can have a big effect. The following information list some of the areas that are affected by weather.

Transportation,
> Rain, wind and snow can be quite disruptive. Flooding can effect rail and road, while snow can stop airports operating, and close down roads and railways. People also tend to travel less in rain, etc

energy supply
> Change in weather patterns can effect energy production, especially in the newer environmental supply systems like wind and solar. The demand for energy also increases at the more extreme ranges of heat and cold. Strong winds can bring down trees which bring down power lines.

food production
> Many crops are sensitive to temperate ranges and are rain dependant. A server storm like a hail storm, can destroy field crops, while also causing flooding. Did you know that Hail Storms cause over 1 billion US$ in crop damage per year.

Health & Medical
> Rain washes down our streets, and removes toxins from our environment into treatment plants. Rain also provides us with drinking water. While rain after a dry spell, can make roads more slippery.

Weddings & Parties, photography, receptions, venues, tourism, sports & leisure

> Sporting events, heat stroke, safety of players, slippyness of playing surfaces, damage to stadiums, betting on horse races.

Communication
> Storms in the upper atmosphere can cause disruption to satellite communications. Storms can also knock our some tv and radio towers, especially with high winds and lightning strikes.

Building & construction
> Rain disrupts building sites, and can make them unsafe. Wind can tear down scaffolding. Poor light restricts building process. Wild weather can damage houses. Wind can spread pollution.

Retail sales
> People donâ€™t go out to shop. Seasons clothes. Can cause depression. Can create panic buying.

Criminal activity.
> Destroys crime scenes, looting after major storms, reduces light / visibility when cloudy, can aid in committing murder.
