# Introduction #

There are two weather datasets that come with Rattle. Both use the same format, variables and data characteristics. The main difference is that the dataset called **weather** uses only one location "Canberra". The other dataset called weatherAUS, are weather statistics near 50 different location in Australia.

All the weather data is sourced with permission from the Australian Bureau of Meterology.
