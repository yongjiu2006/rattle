## Overview ##

Rattle (the R Analytical Tool To Learn Easily) provides a simple and logical interface for data mining. It is a new data mining application based on the open source and free statistical language R  using the Gnome  graphical interface. The application runs under GNU/Linux and MS/Windows. The aim is to provide an intuitive interface that takes you through the basic steps of data mining, as well as illustrating the R code that is used to achieve this. Whilst the tool itself may be sufficient for all of a user's needs, it also provides a stepping stone to more sophisticated processing and modelling in R itself, for sophisticated and unconstrained data mining.
